# Due

**A Canvas dashboard that tells you what to do next.**

Due is a Chrome extension that syncs with any Canvas LMS and lays out every
assignment, deadline, and grade weight in one calm, prioritized dashboard —
no API tokens, no account setup, no server.

## What it does

Canvas buries what matters under menus and tabs. Due strips it down to a single
question: *what should I do next?*

- Click the toolbar icon for a **7-day popup** — everything due this week, plus a pinned "overdue" list, at a glance.
- Open the **dashboard** for the full picture — every course, every assignment, color-coded by urgency, with grade weights and a live grade calculator.

Due signs in as *you*: it borrows your browser's existing Canvas session, so
there's nothing to configure. Log in to Canvas once and it syncs automatically.

## Works with any Canvas school

Due never asks for an API token or a password. It uses the Canvas session
already in your browser, so any school running Canvas works out of the box —
just be logged in.

---

## Install

Due is on the Chrome Web Store — one click, no setup:

**[→ Add Due to Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/due/mgncgfpppjecmfkahchchidfpckpnfid)**

Then **log in to Canvas** and Due syncs automatically on your next visit. Click the Due icon → **Open Dashboard**, and 📌 pin the extension for one-click access. A short 5-step tour opens the first time to walk you through it.

## Privacy

Everything stays on your device. Due has **no backend server, no analytics, and
no telemetry** — all data lives in `chrome.storage.local` and is never sent to
the developer. Read the full [privacy policy](privacy-policy.md).

## For developers

Due is plain **vanilla JavaScript** on **Manifest V3** — no framework, no build step.

```
extension/
├── manifest.json      # MV3 config
├── background.js      # service worker: Canvas API sync + Claude usage
├── popup.html / .js   # toolbar popup (7-day view)
└── dashboard/
    ├── index.html     # dashboard markup + styles
    ├── dashboard.js   # rendering + events
    └── *.js           # taskRules · completion · customAssignments · descSanitizer
```

- **Load it:** after editing anything in `extension/`, reload from `chrome://extensions`.
- **Iterate fast:** run `node dev/serve.js` and open <http://localhost:8765/dev/harness.html>
  (or `popup-harness.html`) to work on the dashboard and popup in a normal tab with mock data.
- **Tests:** the shared logic modules are unit-tested with plain Node — e.g.
  `node extension/dashboard/taskRules.test.js`.

For the full architecture, data model, and design system, see [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).
