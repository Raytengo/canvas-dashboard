# Canvas Dashboard

A Chrome extension for HKUST(GZ) students that pulls course data from Canvas LMS and displays all assignments, deadlines, grade weights, and AI-powered analysis in a clean dashboard — so you always know what to do, how to do it, and when it's due.

## Features

- **7-day popup** — click the extension icon for an instant view of everything due in the next 7 days

- **Course detail view** — click any card to see the full assignment list, grade weight breakdown, and grade calculator
- **Syllabus analysis** — AI reads the course syllabus to extract grade weight components when Canvas doesn't provide them
- **AI assignment analysis** — powered by Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qwen, Moonshot, Zhipu, or MiniMax; generates summaries, requirements, estimated hours, and milestone plans
- **Course renaming** — click the pencil icon on any course detail to set a custom display name (stored locally, never sent to Canvas)
- **Smart filtering** — filter by assignments or exams; toggle submitted items
- **Attendance auto-exclusion** — attendance/participation items are permanently hidden

- **Multi-language UI** — Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, English

## Why this exists

HKUST(GZ) does not allow students to generate Personal Access Tokens for the Canvas API. This extension borrows the browser's existing login session (cookie) to call the Canvas API directly — no token setup required.

2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top right)
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `extension/` folder

## Development notes

- After editing any file in `extension/`, reload the extension at `chrome://extensions`
- `background.js` is a Service Worker — no access to `window` or `document`
- Canvas API returns dates in ISO 8601 (`2026-03-15T23:59:59Z`) — `formatDue()` handles locale-aware display
- Always add `per_page=50` to API calls to reduce pagination overhead
- View Transition named elements in the course card→detail morph: `course-shell`, `course-code`, `course-name`, `course-badge`, `course-meta`
- Any element inside `.detail-name` that participates in layout (e.g. `display: inline-flex`) will change the captured bounding box and distort the View Transition — keep such elements `position: absolute`
